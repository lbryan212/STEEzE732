# AK-40oz's CS:GO Config

This is mainly here to keep track of all my settings, having to start all over was a pain in my a** so I figured I'd create this. 

Put *autoexec.cfg* in `...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg` or take what you want from it and add to your autoexec config! 

*video.txt* needs to be put in `...\Steam\userdata\<Steam3 ID>\730\local\cfg`

	-refresh 240 -tick 128 +fps_max 0 -nojoy -high -fullscreen +mat_disable_fancy_blending 1 +cl_forcepreload 1 -limitvsconst -forcenovsync +r_dynamic 0
