# STEEzE732's CS:GO Config

This is mainly here to keep track of all my settings, having to start all over was a pain in my a** so I figured I'd keep track of all my settings. Feel free to use them however!

Put *autoexec.cfg* in `...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg` or take what you want from it and add to your autoexec config! 

*video.txt* needs to be put in `...\Steam\userdata\<Steam3 ID>\730\local\cfg`
